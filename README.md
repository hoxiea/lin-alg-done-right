# Linear Algebra Done Right - Solutions

My worked solutions to exercises from Sheldon Axler's "Linear Algebra Done Right".

**Note:** This is a work in progress. I am currently working through the book and adding solutions as I go. And there's no guarantee that my solutions are correct!

## Structure

The solutions are organized by chapter:

- Chapter 1A: Real and Complex Numbers
- Chapter 1B: Definition of a Vector Space
- Chapter 1C: Subspaces
- Chapter 2A: Span and Linear Independence
- Chapter 2B: Bases
- Chapter 2C: Dimension (in progress!)

## Viewing the Solutions

You can:

1. View the compiled PDF directly in this repository ([main.pdf](main.pdf))
2. Clone the repository and build locally using Typst
3. Browse the source files in the repository

## Building Locally

With Typst installed:

```bash
typst compile main.typ
```
